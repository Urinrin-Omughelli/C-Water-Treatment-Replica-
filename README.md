# C-Water-Treatment-Replica-

# Objective 
A pellet dispenser capable of dispensing a marble at a time.  
Understanding the Need:  This project will replicate a water treatment system and provides a supporting technology that introduces antivirals to wells and other water bodies to treat water. The pellet dispenser must dispense one marble at a time and stop on command.

# Possible Solutions
An upright cardboard box attached to a cardboard container that holds 75 marbles. The marbles roll down through a path that leads to two wheels connected to two motors on both sides of the robot. The wheels spin the marbles and dispense them one at a time. The wheels stop spinning on command to stop. 

# Define the Solution
The wheels occasionally dispensed two marbles at a time. To stop this, the speed at which the wheels rotated has to be modified in the code and a stopper should be put in order to avoid a small and a large marble from spinning through the wheels at the same time. 

# Implement the Solution
Lego pieces were built around the path leading to the wheels, a stopper was put in between the wheels and the speed in the was increased to allow one marble to be dispensed at a time.
